## Introduction

This project is a small web application designed for a women's clothing and jewelry shop. It showcases the use of React.js for building dynamic UIs, Redux for managing application state, and CSS for responsive design. The application allows users to browse products, view detailed product information, and manage a shopping cart.

## Features

- **Product Listing:** View a selection of women's clothing and jewelry items.
- **Product Details:** Get detailed information about each product, including descriptions and pricing.
- **Shopping Cart Management:** Add or remove items from the shopping cart, with the state managed by Redux.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Data Fetching:** Asynchronous product data fetching from the FakeStoreAPI.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js (v17.x):** Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux (v4.x):** State management library for managing global state.
- **CSS:** For styling the application, including responsive design.
- **ES6 JavaScript:** Utilizing modern JavaScript features for enhanced functionality.
- **FakeStoreAPI:** Used to fetch product data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js (v14.x or higher):** Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **npm (v6.x or higher):** Node package manager, included with Node.js.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elnaggarx/one-order-task.git
   cd one-order-task
## Installation

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
Run the application:
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

Usage
Browse Products: Scroll through the product listings to view available items.
View Product Details: Click on any product to see more information, including a description and price.
Manage Cart: Add items to your cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button. View your cart to adjust quantities or remove items. The cart's state is maintained using Redux, ensuring persistent state across the app.
State Management
Redux is used to manage the global state of the shopping cart. Actions such as adding or removing items are dispatched to update the store, and the cart's contents are accessible throughout the application.
